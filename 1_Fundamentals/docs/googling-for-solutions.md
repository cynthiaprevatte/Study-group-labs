# Thinking Like a Programmer: Googling for Solutions

Believe it or not, one of the most important skills for any programmer is the ability to effectively search the interwebs for solutions to existing problems.

No matter how experienced you are, 98.7% of anything you do will have already been done by someone else. (And 84.3% of statistics are made up, but that percentage is probably pretty close.)

This is a good thing! Chances are someone (or multiple people) has blogged about it or asked a question about it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

## Crafting a Search

This is where the magic happens.

1. Think of a plain English, slightly abstract description of your problem.
1. Add "python" to the beginning.

Examples:

- [python sort a dictionary by value](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+sort+a+dictionary+by+value&oq=python+sort+a+dictionary+by+value&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.424j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- [python combine two lists](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+combine+two+lists&oq=python+combine+two+lists&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.413j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- [python pick out last item from a list](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+pick+out+last+item+from+a+list&oq=python+pick+out+last+item+from+a+list&aqs=chrome..69i57.326j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- [python join list of ints by comma](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+join+list+of+ints+by+comma&oq=python+join+list+of+ints+by+comma&aqs=chrome..69i57.301j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

This is a skill to practice, just like coding.

While you’re breaking your problem down, if there’s an operation you wish you had, google for it and see if someone has written code that does what you need. In other words, don’t just google complete solutions.

## Stack Overflow

Many results will take you to the programming-centric Q&A site, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

The SO community votes up good answers and votes down bad answers. Only pay attention to the _top 1 or 2 answers._ Many lesser answers are, quite frankly, crap.

Oh, and the question may have code in it, but that code usually doesn’t work. That’s why they’re asking the question! Here’s [an example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3294889).
