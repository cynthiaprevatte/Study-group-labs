# doctest

You can do simple unit testing from within the docstrings in your program using the `doctest` module. Full documentation is [here](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/doctest.html).

This is helpful for doing quick sanity tests of your functions. E.g., in our change return exercise, you could structure your program using ‘pure’ functions that are easily testable, then compose them together to get the result you want.

See my, updated version of [change.py](https://github.com/segdeha/pdxcodeguild/blob/master/1.%20Python/solutions/change.py) for an example.
